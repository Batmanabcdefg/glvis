Version 1.1, released on Sep 13, 2010
=====================================

- Anti-aliasing (key 'A') now uses the OpenGL ARB_multisample extension (when
  available). By default, 4x multisampling is used. See file lib/tk.cpp. This
  value can be changed by setting GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE during compilation.

- When drawing subdivided elements, the real normals are now used (at least in
  some cases) to smooth the appearance inside the element, i.e. the surface in
  2D and the (curved) boundary in 3D.

- Enabled the shrinking of elements (F3/F4) and material subdomains (F11/F12)
  for 3D meshes saved using Mesh::PrintWithPartitioning(). This allows for
  better visualization of the interior of the mesh.

- Improved the hex-cutting algorithm to handle all cases of non-flat faces.

- Scripts now work with scalar 3D mesh/solution.

- Changed the makefile to recompile only files that have been changed and to
  allow 'make -j'.

- Various small fixes and styling updates.
