Besides a C++ compiler, GLVis depends on the following external packages:

- the MFEM library (use the latest release)
  http://mfem.googlecode.com

- the LAPACK and BLAS libraries, if MFEM was built to depend on them
  http://www.netlib.org/lapack

- the X11, GL and GLU libraries, which are standard on most Unix-type systems
  http://www.x.org, http://www.opengl.org, http://www.mesa3d.org

- the libtiff library, which can optionally be used for taking screenshots
  http://www.libtiff.org

Two build systems are supported, based on make and SCons, as described below.


Building with 'make'
====================
GLVis comes with a standard makefile, which can be adjusted to specify the paths
to the external libraries, the compiler flags, and if libtiff should be used for
screenshots. Specific options for compiling on Mac OS X are also available.

Some of the available 'make' targets are:

make       -> Builds the glvis binary and the lib/libglvis.a library
make lib   -> Builds only the lib/libglvis.a library
make debug -> Builds a debug version
make clean -> Cleans the build

If LibTIFF is available on your system, modify the makefile by setting
'USE_LIBTIFF = YES'.


Building with 'SCons'
====================
SCons is a Python-based next generation build system from http://www.scons.org/,
which combines the capabilities of make and configure. The included SConstruct
file can be edited to adjust paths to libraries, but the platform-specific
options and the availability of LAPACK, BLAS and libtiff are automatically
detected.

Some of the available 'SCons' targets are:

scons         -> Builds the glvis binary and the lib/libglvis.a library
scons debug=1 -> Builds a debug version
scons -c      -> Cleans the build


Some building considerations:

- GLVis requires the serial version of MFEM without MPI or OpenMP support (its
  default build options). If you have built the parallel (MPI) and/or the OpenMP
  version, you will need to re-build MFEM, e.g., using:

     make clean; make

- To adjust the anti-aliasing settings for your hardware:

  1) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE variable (multisample mode) in
     the makefile/SConstruct file. Supported values can be obtained from the
     'glxinfo' command ('ms' columns) or a from a tool like 'nvidia-settings'.

  2) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MS_LINEWIDTH variable (anti-aliased line
     width) in the makefile/SConstruct file. Note that the same value can
     produce different results depending on the OpenGL implementation.

- If your X11 server does not support GLX 1.3, you can build GLVis to only use
  GLX 1.0 calls, by specifying the GLVIS_GLX10 define. Note that the X11.app in
  OS X complains about GLX 1.3 support, but in practice works fine with GLVis.
