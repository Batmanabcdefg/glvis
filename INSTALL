GLVis is an X11 application and can be built on Linux/Unix systems including
Mac OS X using the X11/XQuarz app.

Besides a C++ compiler, GLVis depends on the following external packages:

- the MFEM library (use the latest release) plus any libraries that MFEM was
  built to depend on
  http://mfem.googlecode.com

- the X11, GL and GLU libraries
  http://www.x.org, http://www.opengl.org, http://www.mesa3d.org

- the libpng or libtiff library; used for taking screenshots (optional)
  http://www.libpng.org, http://www.libtiff.org

- the FreeType 2 and Fontconfig libraries; used for font rendering (optional)
  http://www.freetype.org, http://www.fontconfig.org

The build system is based on GNU make, as described below.


Building with GNU make
======================
GLVis comes with a standard makefile, which can be adjusted to specify the paths
to the external libraries, the compiler flags, etc.

Some of the available 'make' targets are:

make       -> Builds the glvis binary, using the MFEM compiler and options
make opt   -> Builds an optimized version
make debug -> Builds a debug version
make clean -> Cleans the build


Some building considerations:

- On most Linux distributions, the required dependencies (except MFEM) can be
  installed via a package manager. Usually it is sufficient to install the
  packages: libGLU-dev, libpng-dev, and fontconfig-dev with their dependencies
  (actual packages names may vary).

- To adjust the anti-aliasing settings for your hardware:

  1) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MULTISAMPLE variable (multisample mode) in
     the makefile. Supported values can be obtained from the 'glxinfo' command
     ('ms' columns) or a from a tool like 'nvidia-settings'.

  2) Modify the value of the GLVIS_MS_LINEWIDTH variable (anti-aliased line
     width) in the makefile. Note that the same value can produce different
     results depending on the OpenGL implementation.

  3) The above options and some other built-in defaults can be overwritten with
     command line options, see glvis -h for short help.

- If your X11 server does not support GLX 1.3, you can build GLVis to only use
  GLX 1.0 calls, by specifying the GLVIS_GLX10 define. Note that the X11.app in
  OS X complains about GLX 1.3 support, but in practice works fine with GLVis.

- GLVis can be built without libpng/libtiff/FreeType 2/Fontconfig by setting
  the makefile variables USE_LIBPNG/USE_LIBTIFF/USE_FREETYPE to NO.
